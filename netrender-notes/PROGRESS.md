# netrender notes index

This file is the short index to the surviving plans in
`netrender-notes/`. The repo is post-cleanup: vello is the sole
rasterizer on `main`, the upstream WebRender codebase (`webrender_api/`,
`wrench/`, `wr_glyph_rasterizer/`, etc.) has been removed. To spelunk
through the original implementation, check out the
`archive/webrender-0.62-pre-phase-d` tag. (This used to say the code lived
on a `webrender-wgpu-upstream/` side worktree. That checkout is gone; see
[`archive/2026-08-10_branch_archive.md`](archive/2026-08-10_branch_archive.md).)

## Release integration, 2026-08-25

The 0.1.2 release stack is the mainline package contract: `paint_list_api`,
`paint_list_render`, `netrender`, and `netrender_device` carry their published
versions, and the root consumes the published wgpu-30 `netrender-vello` fork.
The regenerated lock records those sources. This closes the stale split where
crates.io consumers selected `netrender` 0.1.2 while git `main` still declared
0.1.1, producing two incompatible `Scene` types in Turnstone.

## Current canonical plans

Audited 2026-08-10. Four files, each with one job, plus a research
record at the end.

- [`2026-05-04_feature_roadmap.md`](2026-05-04_feature_roadmap.md)
  — **the only live checklist.** Phase R plus Phases A–G, every entry
  with a trigger and a done condition. Start here to answer "what is
  left". As of 2026-08-10 the answer is **nothing in this repo**: the two
  remaining items are **D3** (native-compositor handoff, netrender side
  complete, genet adapter 5.5 outstanding and out-of-repo) and **R9**
  (linear-light blending, upstream-blocked on vello's compute path,
  R9-canary will fire when it clears). Everything else in Phases
  0.5'–12b' has shipped with receipts.

  A5 and E3 both opened and closed on 2026-08-10. E1 stays open but is
  upstream-gated and, per its own measurement, not the interesting
  number. **E4** (fragment retention) is **spiked as of 2026-08-12**:
  the pan case that re-lowered the world (17.1 ms at 4096²) runs at
  737 µs with the page retained as one fragment, on mainline vello
  (no fork — `Scene::append` was the only primitive needed). Receipts
  in `pe4_fragment_retention` (7/7), finding at verification record
  §11.36. **Sprigging committed as the first consumer 2026-08-12**; the
  bridge (`translate_paint_cmds_to_fragment` +
  `SceneFragment::from_scene`) and the sprigging-shaped e2e receipt
  live in `paint_list_render`. Genet-side host wiring waits on the
  cambium tree settling. Remaining gaps: hit-test resolution for
  fragments, layer-scoped retention, the host profile. See
  [`2026-08-10_fragment_retention_design.md`](2026-08-10_fragment_retention_design.md) §4.5.

- [`2026-05-01_vello_rasterizer_plan.md`](2026-05-01_vello_rasterizer_plan.md)
  — **the live architecture.** The vello pivot, adopted and delivered.
  Phase 7' (Masonry pattern tile cache) is its architectural heart. §12
  is the phase mapping and the accurate status table.

- [`2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md`](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md)
  — **the evidence.** Split out of the plan on 2026-08-10, where it was
  62% of the file. 36 entries, 34 CLEARED, one per spike or capability.
  Section numbers unchanged, so `§11.x` still resolves. This is the
  append target when a roadmap item lands.

- [`2026-04-30_netrender_design_plan.md`](2026-04-30_netrender_design_plan.md)
  — **axioms and crate rationale only.** Partly superseded: §3 axioms
  and §4 crate structure still hold and are cited by number everywhere,
  but §5's phase plan is replaced by the vello plan's §12, §7's open
  questions are all closed or moot (one of them, the "no `hit_test()`
  entry point" rule, was reversed in the code and is now documented as
  such), and §9's time estimate is dead. Do not read it for direction.

- [`2026-08-04_rasterizer_backend_seam.md`](2026-08-04_rasterizer_backend_seam.md)
  — research record, no implementation proposed. Revisits the vello
  plan's §10 and its 2026-05-01 `vello_hybrid` rejection now that
  hybrid has published 0.1.0 on `wgpu ^29.0.3`. Capability probe
  passes every op netrender lowers, under WebGL2-class limits, on
  wgpu's GL backend. Blocker is that hybrid has no `Scene::append`,
  so Phase 7''s Masonry tile cache has no equivalent and a seam would
  have to tolerate two *retention models*. Also inventories the
  present `vello::Scene` coupling in shared retained state. Posture:
  credible future second backend, not a pending migration.
  Re-verified against hybrid 0.2.0 on 2026-08-10; blocker holds. The ask
  is drafted, unsent, at
  [`2026-08-10_vello_hybrid_upstream_ask.md`](2026-08-10_vello_hybrid_upstream_ask.md).

  **Experiment activated 2026-09-03.** Netrender now names all three Vello
  realizations (`Classic`, `Hybrid`, `Cpu`) while retaining one authoritative
  `Scene`. The opt-in `vello-all` proof pins `mark-ik/all-vellos` at
  `ca3f40ea182216883cd543c7b9deae991268917c`; CPU and Hybrid share one
  geometry/gradient/layer lowerer and return typed admission errors for
  images, patterns, text, filters, and registered fragments that are not yet
  wired. CPU pixel output and Hybrid retained append are covered by focused
  tests. Hybrid also renders through Netrender's wgpu-30 device and passes a
  GPU texture readback. Classic remains the shipping renderer. The next gates
  are images/text, registered fragments, and the rasterizer-independent corpus.

- **Tenancy boot seam (landed 2026-08-10).** `netrender_device` now owns
  booting one device for netrender *and a tenant renderer* drawing into
  the same frame: `TenantNeeds` (required vs optional features, limits,
  label) plus `boot_shared` / `boot_on` and their async forms. The
  tenancy contract is documented on `TenantNeeds`: one device and queue,
  the tenant owns its target texture, composition is explicit at a
  stated scene-op boundary, receipts name the tenant. Arrived from the
  games wing's R4 extraction review, which ruled the seam belongs *up*
  here rather than sideways in a wing crate, since the composition half
  (`ExternalTextureComposite`) was already netrender's. First consumer:
  Paredros's room probe, which previously ran the adapter dance itself
  and carried its own copy of netrender's inter-stage-variable minimum —
  now `REQUIRED_INTER_STAGE_VARIABLES`, stated once. Receipts in
  `netrender_device/tests/tenancy.rs`, including the trap the work
  surfaced: wgpu 29 advertises experimental features on the adapter but
  refuses the device unless they were asked for deliberately, so
  opportunistic grants mask them out.

A running list of post-pivot findings used to sit in this section. It
duplicated the verification record entry by entry and went stale between
updates, so it is gone. The record is the list.

**Workspace state, 2026-08-10:** see the corpus note below for the
current count. `cargo fmt --all --check` clean.

## Paint-list corpus

[`paint_list_render/tests/corpus/`](../paint_list_render/tests/corpus/README.md)
replays consumer `PaintEnvelope` captures through `translate_paint_list`
and asserts the resulting `Scene` op stream against a recorded golden,
plus postcard wire stability and per-fixture provenance. CPU-only, no
GPU needed.

It exists because every other test in this workspace is a scene
netrender wrote for itself, and eight repos depend on this vocabulary.

Five fixtures. Two are real captures off genet's Livery pipeline
(roadmap **A5**), reaching `DrawText` and `DrawBorder`, which no
hand-written test did. Three are hand-built and labelled as such in their
`.provenance`; `nested_stacks` should stay that way, since real scenes
nest too shallowly to reach the case where stack-handling bugs live.
Captures elide font payloads, which is why they are 2 KB rather than
2 MB — see the corpus README for why that is safe and what it costs.

## Host verification

- **2026-07-20 macOS / Metal:** the full workspace suite passes with
  `WGPU_BACKEND=metal`, including Apple system fonts, Apple Color Emoji,
  backdrop filters, registered textures, and compositor plumbing. The pass
  added stable Metal goldens for the two rotated Phase 3 scenes, bounded the
  small cross-submission AA variance in `compose_into`, and fixed offscreen
  filter renders incorrectly sharing retained frame tile-cache state. The
  `demo_card_grid` example also renders successfully through Metal.

## Active follow-up plans (small scope)

- [`2026-05-04_feature_roadmap.md`](2026-05-04_feature_roadmap.md)
  — Phase R (open refinements / wart fixes — was §11.99 of the
  rasterizer plan) + Phases A–G (new capability: diagnostics
  first, then consumer-pull-imminent, then SceneOp expansions,
  then architecturally-significant, then companion lanes).
- [`2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md`](2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md)
  — axiom-14 native-compositor handoff via path (b′). Sub-phases
  5.1–5.4 shipped on netrender side (commit `9447a852b`); 5.5
  genet adapter pending in separate workspace. Roadmap entry:
  D3.
- [`2026-05-06_webgl_over_wgpu_plan.md`](2026-05-06_webgl_over_wgpu_plan.md)
  — WebGL-over-wgpu companion lane. G0–G6 sequence, gated on
  Genet/Pelt consumer pull. Roadmap entry: G.
- [`2026-09-04_wgpu_execution_graph_plan.md`](2026-09-04_wgpu_execution_graph_plan.md)
  — **scope probe complete; implementation not started.** Evolves the
  delivered Phase 6 filter DAG into a validated, inspectable execution plan
  over the existing shared `WgpuHandles`. `vk-graph` is prior art rather than
  a dependency. RG0 is the bounded first slice: deterministic scheduling plus
  typed refusals for duplicate tasks, missing inputs, and cycles. Vello,
  tenant-frame integration, prepared graph shapes, and transient reuse remain
  later consumer-gated steps.
- [`wasm-portability-checklist.md`](wasm-portability-checklist.md)
  — note: this is for the WebRender wgpu-backend work (separate project,
  now the `archive/*` tags), retained for reference. A netrender-specific
  portability list will be authored when F2 (wasm) triggers.

## Archived branches

All non-`main` branches were retired to `archive/*` tags on 2026-08-10.

## Historical / superseded — archived

The plans below predate the vello pivot or have collapsed into other
docs. They describe approaches that are no longer the path forward
or work that has been completed and rolled into the canonical plans.
All have been moved under [`archive/`](archive/) — kept for
historical context, not for guidance.

**Activated and folded:**

- [`archive/2026-05-05_deferred_phases.md`](archive/2026-05-05_deferred_phases.md)
  — was the holding pen for three architecturally-significant
  deferrals (12c' backdrop filter, 13' compositor handoff,
  linear-light blending). All three activated 2026-05-05; canonical
  entries now live on the roadmap as D1, D3, R9. Doc retained as
  the activation history record.

**Pre-vello-pivot (the WebRender wgpu-backend lane):**

- `archive/2026-04-28_idiomatic_wgsl_pipeline_plan.md` — the
  idiomatic-wgpu-pipeline branch's approach (authored WGSL only, no GL,
  no SPIR-V intermediate). Was the active plan before the vello pivot;
  the code is preserved at the `archive/idiomatic-wgpu-pipeline` tag.
- `archive/2026-04-28_renderer_body_wgpu_adapter_plan.md` — `WgpuDevice`
  adapter early-stage planning. Subsumed by netrender_device's
  current shape.
- `archive/2026-04-29_pipeline_first_migration_plan.md` — typed-pipeline
  migration, batch-builder discussion. Pre-cleanup.
- `archive/2026-04-30_phase_d_rollback_to_skeleton.md` — record of the
  rollback that preceded the netrender split.
- `archive/2026-04-30_servo_wgpu_integration_assessment.md` — pre-fork
  servo-integration assessment.
- `archive/2026-04-08_live_full_reftest_confirmation.md` — last
  GL/wrench reftest confirmation before the fork (412/412 passing).
  Now load-bearing prior art for the WebGL-over-wgpu plan §3.1.
- `archive/2026-04-18_spirv_shader_pipeline_plan.md` — dead direction.
- `archive/2026-04-18_upstream_cherry_pick_plan.md` — superseded by the
  fork.
- `archive/2026-04-21_spirv_pipeline_reset_execution.md` — superseded.
- `archive/2026-04-22_upstream_cherry_pick_reevaluation.md` —
  superseded.
- `archive/2026-04-24_tile_with_spacing_validation_error.md` —
  historical bug diagnostic.
- `archive/2026-04-26_track3_legacy_assembly_isolation_lane.md` —
  superseded.
- `archive/2026-04-27_dual_servo_parity_plan.md` — superseded by the
  fork.
- `archive/2026-04-28_session_brief.md` — historical session note.
- `archive/2026-03-01_webrender_wgpu_renderer_implementation_plan.md` —
  the original convergence history, no longer canonical.

**Pre-vello-pivot small-scope plans (WebRender wgpu-backend lane,
code no longer in this repo):**

- `archive/draw_context_plan.md` — `WgpuDrawContext` + encoder
  batching plan against `webrender/src/device/wgpu_device.rs` and
  `webrender/src/renderer/mod.rs`. WebRender lane.
- `archive/typed_pipeline_metadata_plan.md` — flat
  `WgpuShaderVariant` enum to replace `(name, config)` string-tuple
  pipeline keys. WebRender lane.
- `archive/texture_cache_cleanup_plan.md` — WebRender wgpu-backend
  texture subsystem cleanup (`WgpuFrameDataTextures`, dither,
  unsafe-byte-slice utility, mali workaround). WebRender lane.
- `archive/servo_wgpu_integration.md` — Servo + WebRender
  wgpu-backend integration guide (DPR=1/2 confirmed 2026-04-02).
  Pre-vello-pivot. The active netrender-side Servo integration
  story now lives in the path (b′) plan and the WebGL-over-wgpu
  plan; this guide documents the historical lane.

## Local-only

- `archive/` — dated progress snapshots and older branch-shape notes,
  kept for historical traceability.
- `logs/` — local-only, gitignored except for its `.gitignore`. Only
  retain artifacts supporting an active note or unresolved diagnostic.
