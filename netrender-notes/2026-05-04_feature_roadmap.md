# netrender — feature roadmap checklist (2026-05-04, last updated 2026-05-06)

Forward-looking work items in three layers:

- **Open refinements** (Phase R) — known wart fixes on shipped
  features. Each is a specific, bounded change with a documented
  design; gated on consumer pull. Originally lived as §11.99 of
  the rasterizer plan; folded in here so all open items are in
  one place. Move entries into a `§11.x — CLEARED` finding in
  [`2026-05-01_vello_rasterizer_plan.md`](2026-05-01_vello_rasterizer_plan.md)
  when they land.
- **New capability** (Phases A–G) — features the codebase doesn't
  yet express.
- **Out of scope (visibility-only)** — items that are real consumer
  pain but explicitly aren't netrender's job. Listed once so
  embedders know we know; not tracked, no checkbox.

Activation history of the originally-deferred items
(12c' backdrop filter, 13' compositor handoff, linear-light
blending) lives in
[`archive/2026-05-05_deferred_phases.md`](archive/2026-05-05_deferred_phases.md).
All three were activated 2026-05-05; their canonical entries are
on this roadmap (D1, D3, R9 respectively). The 13' design detail
lives in
[`2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md`](2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md).

Each entry has a brief, a trigger, and a done condition — enough to
pick up without re-deriving the design. Where rough line-count
estimates appear, they are sizing hints for sequencing, not
commitments.

**On phase ordering.** Phase A items multiply the value of everything
below them — every B/C/D feature is easier to ship, test, and debug if
A1–A4 are in place. That is the only structural ordering decision in
this file. Phase D is "architecturally significant" by content, not by
priority: D3 is already 4/5 done while Phase A is unstarted. Treat
each item by its individual trigger, not by phase position.

---

## Phase R — Open refinements (consumer-pull-gated wart fixes)

Each entry says what the wart is, when it bites, what specific signal
activates the fix, and the done condition. Move into a
`§11.x — CLEARED` finding in the rasterizer plan when landed.

- [x] **R1. Real font-metric per-glyph hit testing** —
  **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  `glyph_run_per_glyph_hit` now uses `skrifa::metrics::GlyphMetrics`
  for real glyph bounds; em-box fallback only for the no-font
  sentinel, font-parse failures, and glyphs with empty outline
  bounds (e.g., COLR emoji whose outline table is empty).
  Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pr1_per_glyph_hit_metrics.rs`](../netrender/tests/pr1_per_glyph_hit_metrics.rs)
  — clicks on a 'g' descender hit under real metrics where
  em-box would have missed. Full finding:
  [verification record §11.23](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **R2. Per-segment point-in-polygon for `SceneOp::Shape`** —
  **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  `op_contains_point` for `SceneOp::Shape` now AABB-pre-passes then
  calls `kurbo::Shape::contains` on a `BezPath` built from the
  `ScenePath` after inverse-transforming the world point to local.
  Non-invertible transforms fall back to AABB-conservative.
  Sanity-checked against parley's `Selection`-style trigger framing
  per the feedback memory: the wrap was a thin pass-through over
  kurbo's existing API, no speculation. Full finding:
  [verification record §11.20](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **R3. Layer-clip path-precise containment** — **CLEARED
  2026-05-06**.
  Same `kurbo::Shape::contains` machinery as R2, applied to
  `clip_aabb_contains_point`'s `SceneClip::Path` and rounded-rect
  branches. Sharp axis-aligned rect clips skip the path-precise
  check. Non-invertible transforms remain AABB-conservative. Full
  finding: [verification record §11.20](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **R4. Image cache for the simple (non-tile) rasterizer** —
  **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  New `VelloRasterizer` struct mirrors `VelloTileRasterizer`'s
  `image_data` cache for the simple path. Stateful: cache fills on
  first call, subsequent calls only update for added/removed keys.
  Same Path B `register_texture` / `unregister_texture` interface.
  Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pr4_simple_rasterizer_image_cache.rs`](../netrender/tests/pr4_simple_rasterizer_image_cache.rs)
  (7/7). Full finding:
  [verification record §11.24](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **R5. Downscale-blur-upscale for very large blurs** —
  **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  New `blur_kernel_plan_with_downscale(radius)` returns
  `(level, passes, step_px)` where `level ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}` divides
  the work resolution. `build_box_shadow_mask` adds a brush_blur
  step=0 downscale task before the cascade and an upscale task
  after, both relying on the bilinear sampler for AA. Cascade runs
  at the scaled resolution with a smaller effective radius.
  Lifts the σ-clip cap from ~28px up to ~224px (8 × 28). Receipt
  at
  [`netrender/tests/pr5_downscale_blur.rs`](../netrender/tests/pr5_downscale_blur.rs)
  (2/2 GPU + 9/9 CPU planner tests in `blur_plan_tests`). Full
  finding: [verification record §11.28](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **R6. Inline-box rendering helper in `netrender_text`** —
  **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  `netrender_text::push_layout_with_inline_boxes(scene, registry,
  layout, origin, on_inline_box)` walks parley's
  `PositionedLayoutItem` stream once, pushes glyph runs into the
  scene with the existing decoration / font-dedup logic, and emits
  a typed [`InlineBoxPlacement`] (scene-space coordinates,
  consumer-supplied id) per inline box for the consumer to paint.
  The simple `push_layout` / `push_layout_with_registry` entry
  points are now thin wrappers with an empty callback — no behavior
  change. Sanity-check confirmed: parley's `PositionedLayoutItem`
  surface was already in shape, so the wrap was no-speculation
  ship-now work. Full finding:
  [verification record §11.21](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [ ] **R9. Linear-light blending wrap** (rasterizer plan §6.3,
  Pitfall #2; `p1prime_03`).
  *Bites when:* upstream vello's GPU compute path honors
  `peniko::Gradient::interpolation_cs` — until then, gradient
  interpolation and `mix-blend-mode: linear-light` only match CSS
  reference under the `vello_hybrid` path, which we don't use.
  *Trigger:* the **R9-canary** greens (sub-bullet below). Until then,
  fully blocked.
  *Done condition:* `Scene::interpolation_color_space` field
  (default `Srgb` for back-compat) threaded through to
  `peniko::Gradient::with_interpolation_cs`; `p1prime_03` re-greens
  on the GPU path; rasterizer §3.3 caveat block dropped; §6.3
  contract advertises dual capability. Don't pre-build the enum;
  vello's API shape will dictate it.

  - **R9-canary (trigger setup) — wired 2026-05-06.** Test
    `p1prime_03_canary_linear_light_is_honored` in
    [`netrender/tests/p1prime_vello_first_light.rs`](../netrender/tests/p1prime_vello_first_light.rs)
    asserts the **fixed** behavior (LinearSrgb gradient midpoint
    differs from default by ≥ 16/255 per channel). Currently RED
    today (max_chan_diff = 0 — vello GPU path still ignores the
    field). Gated behind the `linear-light-canary` cargo feature
    so default builds stay clean; CI runs
    `cargo test --features linear-light-canary` on vello-dep bumps
    and inspects whether the canary turned green. When it does,
    R9 (the wrap above) becomes pickable; both the canary and the
    twin `p1prime_03_gradient_default_is_srgb_encoded` retire in
    favor of the wrap's own receipts.

---

## Phase A — Diagnostics first

Build the measurement infrastructure before the next round of
features. Every Phase B+ item ships cheaper if these exist: capture a
real consumer scene as a regression artifact, watch the dirty tiles
when adding a primitive, profile the impact when adding a filter.
Order within Phase A is by value-to-cost ratio, smallest first.

- [x] **A1. Op-list inspector** — **CLEARED**.
  `Scene::dump_ops()` ([scene.rs:1444](../netrender/src/scene/mod.rs))
  returns a multi-line per-op summary; non-default transform / clip /
  scene-level alpha / blend modifiers surface inline; nested layer
  scopes indent. Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pa1_op_list_inspector.rs`](../netrender/tests/pa1_op_list_inspector.rs)
  (7/7).

- [x] **A2. Scene capture / replay** — **CLEARED**.
  `Scene::snapshot_postcard` / `replay_postcard` and
  `snapshot_json` / `replay_json` ([scene.rs:2076](../netrender/src/scene/mod.rs))
  ship behind the `serde` feature (off by default — only consumers
  who want capture pull serde + postcard + serde_json). Custom
  `blob_serde` preserves `peniko::Blob` ids across round-trip
  (peniko's built-in serde mints fresh ids); `image_sources_serde`
  normalises HashMap iteration order; `clip_rect_serde` round-trips
  the `±f32::INFINITY` NO_CLIP sentinel. Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pa2_scene_capture_replay.rs`](../netrender/tests/pa2_scene_capture_replay.rs)
  (8/8 with `--features serde`): postcard byte-determinism, JSON
  string-determinism, `dump_ops` semantic round-trip, blob id
  preservation across both formats, image_sources insertion-order
  invariance, malformed-bytes error path.

  **First consumer, 2026-08-10:** the paint-list corpus at
  [`paint_list_render/tests/corpus/`](../paint_list_render/tests/corpus/README.md).
  Note it captures at the `PaintEnvelope` layer rather than the `Scene`
  layer, which A2 did not anticipate: `paint_list_api` already carries
  serde unconditionally, so consumers need no feature flag, and a
  PaintList fixture is rasterizer-independent. That last property is
  what makes the corpus useful to the backend-seam question, since it
  pins consumer-visible behaviour without assuming vello.

- [x] **A3. Tile-dirty visualizer** — **CLEARED**.
  `NetrenderOptions::enable_tile_dirty_overlay`
  ([renderer/init.rs:35](../netrender/src/renderer/init.rs))
  threads through to a per-tile `last_dirty_frame` on `TileCache`
  with an age-fraction window. Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pa3_tile_dirty_tracking.rs`](../netrender/tests/pa3_tile_dirty_tracking.rs)
  (7/7): fresh-invalidate dirties every visible tile, never-dirtied
  excluded, age fraction grows linearly, aged-out tiles drop off,
  unchanged tiles keep their old frame number.

- [x] **A4. Frame profiler** — **CLEARED**.
  New [`netrender::profiling`](../netrender/src/profiling.rs)
  module: `FrameTimings` with a `spans: Vec<NamedSpan>`, `Span`
  RAII type that records start→stop into a target `FrameTimings`,
  and `Renderer::last_frame_timings()`
  ([renderer/mod.rs:856](../netrender/src/renderer/mod.rs)) exposes
  the most recent frame's timings. `std::time::Instant`-based, no
  puffin dep — embedders can drain `FrameTimings::spans` into their
  own profiler. Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pa4_frame_profiler.rs`](../netrender/tests/pa4_frame_profiler.rs)
  (6/6) — including a GPU smoke that confirms `render_vello`
  populates the spans and a second render replaces them.

- [x] **A5. Real captures in the paint-list corpus** — **CLEARED
  2026-08-10.** Two fixtures now carry `captured: yes`, emitted by the
  real pipeline (Livery cascade, Taffy layout, Parley shaping) via
  `genet/components/genet-livery/examples/capture_paint_corpus.rs`:

  - `livery_article_card` — `DrawText` ×4, `DrawBorder` ×2, `DrawRect`
    ×2, a clip scope. Lowers `border-radius` into a rounded-clip layer
    plus an inset `Stroke` with shrunk radii, and carries four real
    Parley-shaped glyph runs (11 / 55 / 41 / 42 glyphs).
  - `livery_nested_rows` — three clip scopes from real `overflow:
    hidden`, per-side borders, three glyph runs.

  Both reach `DrawText` and `DrawBorder`, which no hand-written seed
  did, so the done condition is met.

  The capture source was chosen for cost: `genet-wpt` is the eventual
  scale-up but sits on the full Servo tree, while `genet-livery`'s paint
  tests build and run in well under a second and still exercise a
  genuine HTML → cascade → layout → shaping → paint path.

  *Payload elision.* `FontResource` carries raw TTF bytes inline, so the
  faithful article-card capture was 2,037,474 bytes. Font and image
  payloads are replaced with a stand-in, leaving every command field
  untouched; fixtures are now under 2 KB. Verified rather than assumed —
  a `--keep-payloads` capture blesses to a byte-identical `.ops`. The
  consequence is that elided fixtures translate but do not rasterize,
  which is now the main constraint on adding a GPU tier.

  *Still uncovered:* gradients, images, external textures, box shadows,
  nine-patch borders. Not tracked as a separate item; add fixtures as
  consumers produce them.

---

## Phase B — Consumer-pull-imminent

Things nematic (Gemini, Gopher, Scroll, Markdown, feeds, Finger) and
genet (full web) will surface as parley wiring stabilizes and
graphshell-shaped consumers wire in. Nematic is the smolweb engine in
the Mere workspace (`mere/crates/nematic`); each protocol surfaces
slightly different demands on the renderer (selection in viewers,
caret in composers, scrolling in feed readers).

- [x] **B1. Selection highlight + caret emission** — **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  `netrender_text::selection_rects(layout, range)` and
  `netrender_text::caret_rect(layout, byte_index, affinity, width)`
  ship as thin wrappers over `parley::Selection::geometry` /
  `parley::Cursor::geometry`. Both pure CPU; bidi handled natively
  by parley. Receipts at
  [`netrender_text/tests/pb1_selection_and_caret.rs`](../netrender_text/tests/pb1_selection_and_caret.rs)
  (7/7). Trigger framing was protective rather than technical —
  parley's selection API was already in shape, so the wrap was
  ship-now-no-speculation. Full finding:
  [verification record §11.19](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **B2. Scrolling convenience** — **CLEARED**.
  `Scene::push_scroll_frame(clip_rect, scroll_offset)`
  ([scene.rs:1384](../netrender/src/scene/mod.rs)) opens a layer with
  a rect clip + a translate transform and returns the inner
  `transform_id` for primitives inside the scope. Matching
  `pop_scroll_frame()` is a thin alias for `PopLayer`. Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pb2_scroll_frame.rs`](../netrender/tests/pb2_scroll_frame.rs)
  (6/6): one-call scrolling card list demo, nested scrolls get
  independent transforms, zero offset is pure clip, transform_id
  threads into primitives.

- [x] **B3. Verify: color emoji / COLR fonts** — **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  Verification probe at
  [`netrender_text/tests/pb3_color_emoji_probe.rs`](../netrender_text/tests/pb3_color_emoji_probe.rs)
  measured a 91% chromatic ratio rendering Segoe UI Emoji through
  the vello path. Full finding:
  [verification record §11.18](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).
  No netrender-side work item; re-run the probe on text-stack bumps
  as a regression canary.

---

## Phase C — Capability unlocks (`SceneOp` territory)

New op variants / extensions that genuinely expand what the API can
express. Each is an additive change to `SceneOp`; the rasterizer
gains one match arm per item.

- [x] **C1. Stroke decorations** — **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  `SceneStroke` gained `cap`, `join`, `dash_pattern`, `dash_offset`
  fields with `SceneStrokeCap` (Butt/Round/Square) and
  `SceneStrokeJoin` (Bevel/Miter/Round) enums. Mapped 1:1 to
  `kurbo::Stroke::with_caps` / `with_join` / `with_dashes`. New
  `Scene::push_stroke_decorated` helper. Tile-cache hash includes
  the new fields.
  Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pc1_stroke_decorations.rs`](../netrender/tests/pc1_stroke_decorations.rs)
  (8/8). Full finding:
  [verification record §11.25](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **C2. `SceneOp::Pattern`** — **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  New `ScenePattern { tile, extent, scale, transform_id, clip_rect,
  clip_corner_radii }` op variant tiles an `ImageKey` across an
  extent rect via vello's `Extend::Repeat`. New `Scene::push_pattern`
  helper. Hit-testing reports `HitOpKind::Pattern`. Tile-cache hash
  invalidates on tile/extent/scale changes.
  Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pc2_pattern_op.rs`](../netrender/tests/pc2_pattern_op.rs)
  (8/8). Full finding:
  [verification record §11.26](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **C3. Mask-image fills** — **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  New `SceneCompose` enum (SrcOver / DestIn) added as a per-layer
  field on `SceneLayer`. `SceneLayer::alpha_mask()` and
  `Scene::push_alpha_mask_layer` open an inner DestIn layer; with
  the standard outer-layer-then-content pattern, content survives
  only where the inner layer's draws are opaque. No new shader
  needed — vello's existing peniko BlendMode supports DestIn
  natively. Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pc3_alpha_mask_layer.rs`](../netrender/tests/pc3_alpha_mask_layer.rs)
  (5/5 — including GPU smoke that proves a half-and-half mask
  shows content on one side and zero on the other). Full finding:
  [verification record §11.29](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **C4. Variable fonts axis interpolation** — **CLEARED 2026-05-06**.
  `SceneGlyphRun` gained `font_axis_values: Vec<(SceneFontAxisTag,
  f32)>` (4-byte ASCII tags + user-space values, e.g.,
  `(*b"wght", 700.0)`). `emit_glyph_run` resolves user→normalized
  via `skrifa::Axes::location` and threads through to vello's
  `DrawGlyphs::normalized_coords`. New `Scene::push_glyph_run_variable`
  helper. Tile-cache hash includes axis values.
  Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pc4_variable_fonts.rs`](../netrender/tests/pc4_variable_fonts.rs)
  (7/7) — including a GPU smoke that renders Bahnschrift at three
  weights and verifies bold paints visibly more ink than light. Full
  finding:
  [verification record §11.27](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

---

## Phase D — Architecturally significant

Items that need real design conversation, not just implementation.

- [x] **D1. Backdrop filter** — **CLEARED 2026-05-08**.
  New `SceneFilter::Blur(f32)` enum + `SceneLayer.backdrop_filter:
  Option<SceneFilter>` field. `Renderer::render_vello` detects
  backdrop layers, pre-renders the scene-prefix to a texture,
  blurs it via the existing render-graph (R5's downscale path
  applies for large radii), and injects a `SceneImage` covering
  the layer's bounds at the start of the layer's scope.
  Multi-pass orchestration is opaque to the consumer; no separate
  API call. Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pd1_backdrop_filter.rs`](../netrender/tests/pd1_backdrop_filter.rs)
  (4/4) — including a GPU smoke that verifies a busy striped
  background under a `Blur(12)` filter shows >50% reduction in
  local horizontal variance compared to the unfiltered reference.
  Full finding:
  [verification record §11.30](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **D2. Animated values** — **CLEARED 2026-05-08**.
  New [`netrender::interpolate`](../netrender/src/interpolate.rs)
  module: CSS timing curves (`linear`, `ease`, `ease_in`,
  `ease_out`, `ease_in_out`, `step_start`, `step_end`,
  `cubic_bezier`), generic `lerp` for scalar / array / color, and
  `sample_keyframes` for keyframe-driven animation. All pure
  functions; no clock, no Scene-side state. Consumer drives time
  and rebuilds the Scene per frame with resolved values — keeps
  the determinism invariant from A2 intact. Receipt: 14 unit
  tests in `netrender::interpolate::tests`. Full finding:
  [verification record §11.31](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [ ] **D3. Native-compositor handoff (axiom 14) via path (b′)** —
  exporting per-surface textures to native OS compositors so the OS
  applies transform / clip / opacity at 60Hz without re-rasterizing.
  *Status:* see
  [`2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md` §5](2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md).
  Sub-phases 5.1–5.4 shipped; 5.5 (genet adapter) lives in the
  `genet` repo. **Do not duplicate sub-phase status here — the
  compositor plan is canonical.**
  Sub-phase 5.5 has hit **cut milestone** in genet (master path
  through `Paint::render` against the `WgpuMasterCaptureBackend`,
  `WindowsDxgiBackend` real on Windows with a working pelt smoke,
  CALayer + Wayland backends skeletoned). Full done-condition
  (per-platform OS handoff installed by default + per-`SurfaceKey`
  declared-surface presents wired) is the remaining 5.5 work.
  *Trigger:* 5.5 done-condition lands in genet (not just cut milestone).
  *Done condition:* mark complete and migrate to a `§11.x — CLEARED`
  finding in the rasterizer plan.

---

## Phase E — Performance / scaling

Don't pre-build; profile under real consumer load first. E2 is gated
on Phase A4 (frame profiler) data. E1 is **upstream-blocked, not
A4-gated** — listed for visibility only.

- [ ] **E1. GPU damage tracking (sub-tile)** — *upstream-gated.*
  Today vello re-encodes the whole scene every frame. For scrolling
  content where most of the screen is unchanged, this is wasted
  compute. The fix lives at vello's encoder level and is upstream's
  responsibility — see rasterizer §13 risk #8 (accepted). Track but
  don't start; requires upstream coordination. No netrender-side done
  condition; entry exists for visibility.

  **Measured 2026-08-10, and the premise did not hold up.** A4 spans
  under a one-dirty-tile sweep
  ([`netrender/examples/e1_damage_profile.rs`](../netrender/examples/e1_damage_profile.rs),
  RTX 4060 / Vulkan, release):

  | viewport | tiles | ops | dirty | invalidate | rebuild | compose | vello | total |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 512² | 4 | 62 | 1 | 6.3 | 4.3 | 3.1 | 205.5 | 219.3 |
  | 1024² | 16 | 296 | 1 | 40.5 | 5.4 | 6.7 | 221.0 | 275.2 |
  | 2048² | 64 | 1094 | 1 | 295.2 | 8.4 | 18.6 | 226.1 | 545.8 |
  | 4096² | 256 | 4422 | 1 | 3428.1 | 25.3 | 100.9 | 404.4 | 3939.0 |

  Microseconds, median of 30 frames. `vello` grows 2× across a 64×
  increase in tiles, so it is not the bottleneck for a mostly-static
  frame. The cost was **E3** below, now cleared. Even after E3 took
  `invalidate` down 8.2×, vello is not what dominates a static frame at
  this scale, so do not open an upstream conversation about E1 citing
  scrolling cost without fresh numbers that actually support it. Full
  finding: [verification record §11.35](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **E2. Multi-thread scene building** — **CLEARED 2026-05-08**.
  New `SceneFragment` builder type + `Scene::append_fragment`
  join API. Each fragment carries its own ops / transforms /
  fonts / image_sources; on append, fragment-local ids are
  rewritten to the parent scene's index space (identity at id 0
  / sentinel font at id 0 stay at 0). Consumer-supplied
  ImageKeys are not remapped — partition the keyspace per
  thread. Receipt at
  [`netrender/tests/pe2_scene_fragment.rs`](../netrender/tests/pe2_scene_fragment.rs)
  (9/9) — including a 4-thread parallel build of 10k ops that
  confirms the API works end-to-end. Full finding:
  [verification record §11.32](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **E3. `TileCache::invalidate` was O(tiles × ops)** — **CLEARED
  2026-08-10.** New [`tile_cache::index`](../netrender/src/tile_cache/index.rs)
  files every op into the bins of the tiles its world AABB covers, in one
  O(ops) pass, storing `(op_index, u64 digest)`. Each tile then hashes
  only its own bin, merged by index with the layer-scope ops that apply
  to every tile. `invalidate` column, microseconds, same machine and
  scene as the baseline below:

  | viewport | ops | before | after | per-op after |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 512² | 62 | 6.3 | 5.9 | 95 ns |
  | 1024² | 296 | 40.5 | 26.9 | 91 ns |
  | 2048² | 1094 | 295.2 | 97.9 | 89 ns |
  | 4096² | 4422 | 3428.1 | 419.3 | 95 ns |

  **8.2× at 4096², and the per-op cost is flat across a 55× spread in
  tiles × ops** — the done condition, met: cost now tracks op count, not
  the product. `invalidate` fell from ~87% of the frame to ~36%, and
  whole-frame total from ~3.9 ms to ~1.15 ms.

  The residual ~95 ns/op is the floor for this design: every op is
  digested once per frame because the consumer rebuilds the `Scene` each
  frame, so there is no op identity to cache a digest against. Going
  below it means incremental scene construction, which is a consumer-side
  design change, not a tile-cache one.

  *Correctness:* the pre-E3 function is retained under `cfg(test)` as
  `hash_tile_deps_reference`, and 8 differential tests assert the two
  produce identical **dirty sets** (not identical hashes — the fast path
  mixes per-op digests). They cover reordering two overlapping
  primitives, moving a primitive across a `PushLayer` boundary,
  scene-level alpha, off-grid and full-bleed primitives, and degenerate
  or tile-aligned bounds. `pa3_tile_dirty_tracking` passes unchanged,
  including `moved_rect_under_stable_transform_id_dirties_its_tile`.
  Layer ops still conservatively dirty every tile; E3 deliberately did
  not touch that rule.

  Receipt: 8 differential tests in
  [`netrender/src/tile_cache/index.rs`](../netrender/src/tile_cache/index.rs)
  plus `pa3_tile_dirty_tracking` (8/8) unchanged. Full finding:
  [verification record §11.35](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).

- [x] **E4. Fragment retention (incremental scene construction)** —
  **SPIKED 2026-08-12**; mechanism proven locally, consumer contract
  still gated. The motivating measurement: a placement-only camera pan
  re-lowered the world (17.1 ms at 4096² in the spike run, 90%+ in
  `dirty_tile_rebuild`), because the tile cache cannot tell "changed"
  from "moved". With the page retained as one fragment, the same pan
  frame is **737 µs**, 23×, fragment lowered once across 30 frames,
  no vello changes needed (mainline `Scene::append` suffices).
  Receipts: `pe4_fragment_retention` (7/7), pixel-identity-first.
  Full finding:
  [verification record §11.36](2026-05-01_vello_verification_record.md).
  Design: [`2026-08-10_fragment_retention_design.md`](2026-08-10_fragment_retention_design.md).

  **Still open before E4 closes for real** (the original trigger — a
  committed consumer plus an end-to-end emit+translate+render profile —
  applies to this list, not to the spike):
  - Hit testing does not resolve fragment content (no registry access
    from `hit_test`). The likeliest shape is a renderer-side entry
    point; decide against a consumer.
  - Layer-scoped placements fall back to un-retained inlining
    (pixel-correct, warned). Fine until a consumer's real scenes say
    otherwise.
  - The A3 dirty-overlay vocabulary has no fragment-path equivalent.
  - Wire-level fragment refs in `paint_list_api` remain out of scope.

## Phase F — Platform / output

Bigger commitments that broaden what platforms / output formats the
renderer reaches.

- [ ] **F1. HDR / wide-gamut output** — Display P3 / Rec2020.
  *Trigger:* vello's color-pipeline trajectory exposes a P3 / Rec2020
  storage-target option. Watch and wait, not build.
  *Done condition:* a render target in P3 produces visibly more
  saturated reds/greens/blues vs. sRGB on a P3-capable display.

- [x] **F2. WebAssembly target — library readiness** — **CLEARED 2026-05-08**.
  Audit found `cargo check -p netrender --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`
  already passed clean — the only wasm-runtime hazard in lib code was
  `pollster::block_on` in `netrender_device::core::boot`. Fixed by
  splitting the boot into a portable async core
  [`netrender_device::boot_async`](../netrender_device/src/core.rs)
  and gating the blocking `boot()` wrapper to
  `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`. Browser consumers call
  `boot_async().await` from `wasm-bindgen-futures::spawn_local` (or any
  executor); native consumers keep the existing blocking entry point.
  `WgpuDevice::boot_async` mirrors the pattern. Both `netrender_device`
  and `netrender` now `cargo check` clean against
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. F2's prior framing as "real cost (wasm
  build infra)" was a protective gate — the technical work was a
  thin-wrap shape over `wgpu`'s already-async API. The wasm-bindgen
  *demo* crate (running the card grid in a browser canvas) is real
  consumer work and remains gated on a real consumer commitment, but
  that's an embedder example, not a netrender library cost.
  *Note:* the existing `wasm-portability-checklist.md` in this
  directory is for the WebRender wgpu-backend branch (a separate
  project) and never applied to netrender's smaller surface area.

## Phase G — WebGL-over-wgpu companion lane

The OpenGL-content path for Genet/Pelt. Web pages do not get raw
OpenGL; they get WebGL/WebGL2. The target architecture is **WebGL API
compatibility over wgpu**, sitting beside NetRender — not inside
NetRender core. NetRender's job is the final composition surface
(place the canvas texture in painter order, clip/transform it,
participate in damage and presentation), not WebGL's API state
machine, extension matrix, shader-language validation, or
resource-lifetime semantics.

- [ ] **G. WebGL-over-wgpu adapter crate** — full sub-plan in
  [`2026-05-06_webgl_over_wgpu_plan.md`](2026-05-06_webgl_over_wgpu_plan.md).
  *Trigger:* Genet/Pelt commits to a canvas-bearing demo, or a
  WebGL-using site enters the test set.
  *Done condition:* covered by the sub-plan's G0–G6 sequence; the
  netrender-side hook lands as part of G4 (texture compositing). The
  rest is sibling-crate or test-infra work.

  - **G4 netrender-side hook — CLEARED 2026-05-16.**
    `ExternalTextureComposite` with `scene_op_boundary` plus
    `VelloTileRasterizer::render_overlay_fragment` deliver ordered
    texture compositing: z-order over text/rects, opacity blending,
    same-device direct sampling (no readback round-trip). Receipts at
    [`netrender/tests/pg4_webgl_canvas_texture.rs`](../netrender/tests/pg4_webgl_canvas_texture.rs)
    — including `pg4_webgl_canvas_texture_preserves_scene_order` for
    the new ordered path. G0–G3 / G5 / G6 remain as sibling-crate work
    in genet/pelt; the netrender library surface that G needs is
    complete.

## Out of scope (visibility-only)

Real consumer pain that is explicitly *not* netrender's job. Listed
once so embedders know we know; no checkbox, not tracked.

- **CSS font-cascade rules** (rasterizer plan §4.4). DirectWrite /
  CoreText-style font selection (CJK fallback chains, `font-family`
  priority lists with locale-aware preferences). Fontique enumerates
  system fonts but doesn't implement the full cascade. Embedders that
  need this implement it on top of fontique or wrap a system text
  engine.

- **Synthetic bold/italic via parley `Synthesis`**
  (`netrender_text` doc). Parley's `Synthesis` flags are ignored.
  Consumer recommendation: use real bold/italic font files instead.
  Flagged for visibility; not a netrender concern.

## When to revisit this list

Add an item when a real consumer surfaces a need that doesn't fit the
current API. Move an item out of the list (into a `§11.x — CLEARED`
plan finding) when it lands. Re-order liberally based on what the
consumer is actually using.
