//! Native-compositor handoff trait — axis 14, path (b′).
//!
//! See
//! [`netrender-notes/2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md`](../../netrender-notes/2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md)
//! for the full design. Sub-phase 5.1 (this module) is scaffolding —
//! types and trait shape, no per-surface dirty logic yet. Renderer
//! always calls `present_frame` with `layers = &[]`.
//!
//! The trait + types live here in `netrender_device` so the consumer-
//! facing import surface is one crate. `netrender` is upstream of
//! `netrender_device` (depends on it) — putting consumer-facing
//! types here avoids a crate cycle.
