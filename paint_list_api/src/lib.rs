//! `paint_list_api` — the trait + common vocabulary every engine emits
//! into and NetRender renders from. See
//! `genet/docs/2026-05-17_paintlist_polyglot_renderer.md` (design,
//! PM-3 resolution) and `genet/docs/2026-05-20_paintlist_extraction_plan.md`
//! (the move into this neutral netrender-workspace crate).
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! - [`PaintList`] is the producer-facing trait engines implement.
//!   Concrete impls (`GenetPaintList`, `NematicPaintList`,
//!   `ScryingPaintList`, inker's document list) live in their respective
//!   engine crates and carry richer internal state (palettes, spatial
//!   trees) behind the trait's [`PaintList::commands`] view.
//! - [`PaintCmd`] is the closed-set command stream the renderer pattern-
//!   matches against. Compositor primitives push/pop composition state;
//!   `Draw*` primitives emit one item each. PM-3: no generic extension
//!   hole — engine-specific items either map to common ops or hand off
//!   via [`PaintCmd::DrawExternalTexture`].
//! - [`primitives`] holds the engine-facing display-list vocabulary
//!   (color, euclid geometry, border/line/blend enums). This crate owns
//!   that vocabulary; it does **not** depend on netrender. The
//!   `paint_list_render` crate translates `PaintCmd` → `netrender::Scene`
//!   and is the only place the two vocabularies meet.
//!
//! ## Lowering contract
//!
//! The renderer owns [`PaintCmd`] → `netrender::Scene` translation. The
//! `DrawExternalTexture` lowering specifically is the per-frame
//! compositor pass (`ExternalTextureComposite` with `scene_op_boundary`),
//! **not** a vello `SceneOp::Image`. This sidesteps tile-cache
//! invalidation for mutating textures (WebGL canvas, embedded
//! iframes, paint worklet output, etc.) by construction.
