//! `netrender_text` — `parley::Layout` → `netrender::Scene` adapter.
//!
//! Bridges parley's shaped/laid-out text into a netrender Scene as
//! `SceneGlyphRun`s. The adapter is one-way: parley owns shaping,
//! line-breaking, BiDi reordering, font fallback, and alignment;
//! netrender owns GPU rasterization.
//!
//! ## Design boundary
//!
//! The contract between text-layout and render is a **data type**:
//! `netrender::SceneGlyphRun`. Any shaper that produces SceneGlyphRuns
//! is interchangeable. This crate is *the parley adapter* — if a
//! consumer wants `cosmic-text` instead, they write
//! `netrender_cosmic_text` that emits SceneGlyphRuns the same way;
//! nothing in `netrender` or `netrender_text` needs to change.
//!
//! There is deliberately no `Shaper` trait on the netrender side —
//! see the rasterizer plan §2.2's "abstraction without users"
//! reasoning, which applies identically to text.
//!
//! ## Brush type
//!
//! The brush is fixed to `[f32; 4]` (premultiplied RGBA, matching
//! netrender's color contract). To vary color across runs in the
//! same layout, push styled spans with different brushes via parley's
//! builder before laying out:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut builder = layout_cx.ranged_builder(&mut font_cx, text, 1.0, true);
//! builder.push_default(StyleProperty::Brush([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]));
//! builder.push(StyleProperty::Brush([1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]), 5..10);
//! let layout = builder.build(text);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Font registration
//!
//! Within a single `push_layout` call, fonts are deduped: the same
//! `parley::FontData` referenced by multiple runs registers only
//! once with the scene. Across calls, fonts re-register — if you
//! call `push_layout` repeatedly on the same scene with the same
//! font, `scene.fonts` accumulates duplicates. A persistent
//! cross-call font map is a future addition; for one-frame consumers
//! it's irrelevant, and for streaming consumers a per-frame Scene
//! rebuild is the typical pattern.
//!
//! ## Decorations (underline / strikethrough)
//!
//! Both are painted as filled rects spanning the glyph run's
//! horizontal advance, with thickness and offset taken from
//! parley's `RunMetrics` (font-supplied) or the per-style override
//! when set. Painting order follows the CSS text-decoration spec:
//! underline → glyphs → strikethrough, so the strikethrough
//! crosses through the glyphs and the underline sits cleanly below
//! their descenders.
//!
//! ## What this crate does NOT do
//!
//! - Inline boxes (`PositionedLayoutItem::InlineBox`). Skipped — the
//!   consumer placed those, the consumer renders them.
//! - Synthesis (synthetic bold/italic). parley's `run.synthesis()`
//!   returns hints; netrender's glyph pipeline currently doesn't
//!   honour them. Use real bold/italic font files instead.
