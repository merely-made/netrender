//! Phase 8' — netrender Scene → vello::Scene gradient ingestion.
//!
//! Three probes covering linear, radial-circular, and conic. The
//! gradients all interpolate in sRGB-encoded space (vello's GPU
//! compute path ignores `interpolation_cs` per p1prime_03), so
//! midpoints land where the existing Phase 8 batched receipts
//! would land them.
//!
//! - `p8prime_01_linear_red_to_blue` — horizontal red→blue gradient,
//!   midpoint expects (128, 0, 128).
//! - `p8prime_02_radial_circular_red_to_transparent` — circular
//!   radial centered at canvas center, red→transparent, sample at
//!   center expects red and far-corner expects transparent.
//! - `p8prime_03_conic_red_to_blue_seam_zero` — conic with seam at
//!   angle 0, red at start, blue at end; sample on the +x axis (just
//!   past seam) is red, on the -x axis (halfway around) is purple
//!   (sRGB-encoded midpoint of red→blue).
