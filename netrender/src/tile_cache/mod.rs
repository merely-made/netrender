//! Phase 7A — picture-cache invalidation algorithm.
//!
//! This module implements the *algorithm* portion of Phase 7: hashing
//! per-tile primitive dependencies, frame-stamping seen tiles, and
//! reporting which tiles changed between two `invalidate(scene)` calls.
//! Tile texture allocation + per-tile rendering land in Phase 7B; the
//! `Tile` struct intentionally has no `texture` field yet.
//!
//! Algorithm:
//!   1. Tick `current_frame`.
//!   2. For each tile in the viewport grid: hash every primitive
//!      whose world AABB intersects the tile (in painter order),
//!      compare against the tile's `last_hash`, and report new or
//!      changed tiles as dirty (updating the cached hash). Mark
//!      every tile seen this frame.
//!
//!   3. Evict tiles whose `last_seen_frame` is more than `RETAIN_FRAMES`
//!      stale (Arc drop, wgpu reclaims memory in Phase 7B+).
//!
//! The hash uses `DefaultHasher` (SipHash-1-3) — fast, deterministic
//! within a process, and good enough to make collisions astronomically
//! unlikely for the kind of state that fits in a primitive struct.
