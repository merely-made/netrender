//! `Renderer` shell — vello-backed.
//!
//! Public entry point: [`Renderer::render_vello`]. The renderer
//! owns a [`crate::vello_tile_rasterizer::VelloTileRasterizer`]
//! (constructed at init when `NetrenderOptions::enable_vello` is
//! true) and a [`TileCache`] (constructed when
//! `NetrenderOptions::tile_cache_size` is `Some(_)`). Both must be
//! present for `render_vello` to succeed.
//!
//! The Renderer used to host a parallel batched-WGSL rasterizer
//! (`prepare()` / `render()` returning `PreparedFrame`); that path
//! was retired in favor of a single vello pipeline. The brush
//! pipeline factories on `WgpuDevice` (brush_blur, clip_rectangle)
//! are still used by render-graph tasks, but the rasterizer-side
//! brush_solid / brush_rect_solid / brush_image / brush_gradient
//! factories are now unreachable from netrender; they're slated for
//! removal from `netrender_device` in a follow-up.
//!
//! Phase mapping after the cleanup:
//!
//! - **Phase 6** (render-graph for filters / blur / clip-mask
//!   tasks) lives on, intersecting with the rasterizer via
//!   [`Renderer::insert_image_vello`] — render-graph outputs
//!   become image sources for vello scenes.
//! - **Phase 7** picture caching is now the [`TileCache`]
//!   algorithm + the per-tile `vello::Scene` cache inside
//!   `VelloTileRasterizer`.
//! - **Phase 8** gradients (linear / radial / conic / N-stop) are
//!   `peniko::Gradient` mapped from `SceneGradient`; see
//!   `vello_rasterizer::scene_to_vello`.
//! - **Phase 9** clips are vello `push_layer` shapes (axis-aligned
//!   today; arbitrary path on Phase 9' completion).
