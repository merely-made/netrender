//! Roadmap A4 — per-frame timing diagnostics.
//!
//! Records named-span durations per render call. Captured on the
//! rasterizer side and surfaced via [`Renderer::last_frame_timings`]
//! for embedders who want to display per-phase costs (Vello encode,
//! tile invalidate, master compose, etc.) under load.
//!
//! The implementation is a thin wrapper over [`std::time::Instant`];
//! no `puffin` or other profiling-crate dep is required. If a future
//! consumer wants integration with a process-wide profiler, they can
//! drain `FrameTimings::spans` into the profiler's API and call this
//! module's spans the names of their choice.
//!
//! Design choices:
//!
//! - **`Vec<NamedSpan>` over named fields.** Adding a span (e.g., a
//!   future Vello-internal subspan) doesn't break the API.
//! - **Explicit `total` field.** Computed by an outer `Instant`
//!   span around the whole render. Decouples "wall-clock total" from
//!   the sum of `spans` so nested spans (added later) don't confuse
//!   the total semantics.
//! - **`&'static str` names.** No allocation per span; names are
//!   compile-time constants chosen by the recorder.
