//! Phase 6 render-task graph.
//!
//! Tasks declare their input dependencies by ID; the graph topo-sorts
//! (Kahn's algorithm) and encodes all passes into a single
//! `CommandEncoder`. Each task's output texture is allocated at execute
//! time; callers supply pre-existing textures for "external" sources
//! (uploaded images, prior frame tiles, etc.).
//!
//! Typical use: build blur or filter sub-graphs, execute them before
//! `Renderer::prepare`, insert the resulting textures into the image
//! cache via `ImageCache::insert_gpu`, then composite them as images
//! in the main scene pass.
